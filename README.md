# API-Mastery-Python

This repository is dedicated to mastering `API development` using Python, covering key technologies such as FastAPI for efficient API building, SQL and `PostgreSQL` for robust database management, Docker for containerization, and deployment on AWS for scalable production environments. Join me on this journey to build a solid foundation in API development from start to finish.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to API development with Python, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced topics. By following along, you'll gain hands-on experience with modern API development practices and tools.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for database interaction.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **AWS**: Amazon Web Services, a comprehensive cloud computing platform.

## Setup and Installation

### Make your own Virtual enviornment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Select Your Virtual Environment (VS Code):

- Press Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) to open the command palette.
- Type Python: Select Interpreter and select the virtual environment you created (it should show a path ending with venv).

### Activate the Virtual Environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Fast API
- [FastAPI Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)

```bash
pip install fastapi
```
